<h3> About the Project: </h3>

<p>  The Coin_Bank_App seeks to help users simplify their Cyrpto accounts by aggregating the balances of their wallets without having to login to each wallet to see what their current values are. Crypto holders who have their coins outside of a brokerage account are usually forced to have a different wallet for each type of coin since most wallets dont support coins on a different network. </p>
<br>

<p>
Very few wallets will support different networks with the exception of cold storage wallets like Trezor or Ledger.
</p>
<br>


<h3>
Getting Started:

</h3>
<p>
    Users will enter the name of their wallet, type of coins and amount. Based on the users data entries the app will aggregate the total value of each wallet and display it on a simple dashboard/account summary page. </p>
